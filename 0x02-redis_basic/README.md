## Introduction

This class covers the basics of Redis, a powerful in-memory data structure store, and how to use it for various operations and as a simple caching solution.

## Learn How to Use Redis for Basic Operations

### Introduction to Redis

- What is Redis?
- Use cases for Redis
- Installing Redis

### Getting Started with Redis

- Connecting to a Redis server
- Basic Redis commands (SET, GET, DEL, EXISTS)
- Data types in Redis (Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes)

### Working with Strings

- Setting and getting string values
- Incrementing and decrementing values
- String commands (APPEND, STRLEN, etc.)

### Working with Lists

- Pushing and popping values
- Retrieving values from lists
- List commands (LRANGE, LINDEX, etc.)

### Working with Sets

- Adding and removing members
- Checking membership
- Set commands (SADD, SREM, SMEMBERS, etc.)

### Working with Sorted Sets

- Adding and removing members with scores
- Retrieving members based on score range
- Sorted set commands (ZADD, ZRANGE, ZSCORE, etc.)

### Working with Hashes

- Setting and getting hash fields
- Retrieving all fields and values
- Hash commands (HSET, HGET, HGETALL, etc.)

### Expiring Keys

- Setting key expiration
- Checking remaining time
- Expiration commands (EXPIRE, TTL, etc.)

### Transactions

- Using MULTI, EXEC, DISCARD, and WATCH

## Learn How to Use Redis as a Simple Cache

### Introduction to Caching

- What is caching?
- Benefits of caching
- When to use caching

### Setting Up Redis as a Cache

- Configuring Redis for caching
- Caching patterns (write-through, write-behind, cache-aside)

### Basic Caching Operations

- Caching data with SET and GET
- Setting expiration times for cached data
- Eviction policies (LRU, LFU, etc.)

### Cache Invalidation

- Strategies for cache invalidation
- Implementing cache invalidation in Redis

### Using Redis with Different Data Types for Caching

- Caching strings
- Caching lists
- Caching objects using hashes

### Monitoring and Managing Redis Cache

- Monitoring cache performance
- Managing cache size and memory usage
- Redis commands for monitoring (INFO, MONITOR, etc.)

### Advanced Caching Techniques

- Using Redis as a session store
- Implementing distributed caching with Redis
- Using Redis with other caching layers (e.g., CDN)
